## Objectives
1. Add conversation capability to post-transcript menu
2. Implement DALL-E 3 for image generation
3. Create conversation logging system

## Task Details

| Task | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Post-transcript conversation | Add ability for users to ask open questions to the assistant after transcript processing | - Menu option added to process menu<br>- User can enter free-form questions<br>- Assistant provides relevant answers<br>- Conversation history maintained during session | To Do |
| Conversation logging | Save conversation history to files | - Conversations saved to data/conversation directory<br>- File naming includes timestamp<br>- Full conversation context preserved | To Do |
| DALL-E 3 integration | Update image generation to use DALL-E 3 | - Image generation uses DALL-E 3 model<br>- Quality settings maintained<br>- Existing UI remains consistent | To Do |

## Context
The application currently uses gpt-image-1 for image generation and doesn't have conversation capabilities. We need to enhance it by:
1. Adding a new option to the process menu for open conversations with the assistant
2. Creating a persistent conversation log in data/conversation
3. Upgrading the image generation from gpt-image-1 to DALL-E 3

## Next Steps
1. Modify the process_transcript_workflow() function to add conversation option
2. Create conversation module or functions for handling assistant interaction
3. Update image_gen.py to use DALL-E 3 model
4. Create data/conversation directory and implement logging functionality
5. Test all implementations and ensure backward compatibility
