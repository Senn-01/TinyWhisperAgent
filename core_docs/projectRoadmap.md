# Project Roadmap (v2)

## Project Overview
Whisper Transcription Tool is a comprehensive Python application for audio recording, transcription, and processing using OpenAI's Whisper API and GPT models.

## High-Level Goals
1. Provide a user-friendly interface for audio transcription
2. Enable advanced processing of transcribed text
3. Offer image generation capabilities based on transcripts
4. Ensure robust error handling and logging
5. Maintain a well-organized and maintainable codebase
6. Keep the application simple and focused (KISS principle)

## Key Features
- [✓] Audio recording from microphone
- [✓] Transcription via OpenAI's Whisper API (whisper-1 model only)
- [✗] ~~Speaker diarization~~ (removed for simplification)
- [✓] Text processing (summaries, key points, action items)
- [✓] Transcript reformatting and translation
- [✓] Sentiment analysis
- [✓] Image generation based on transcripts
- [✓] File management system
- [✓] Rich terminal UI

## Completion Criteria
- [✓] All key features implemented
- [✓] Comprehensive error handling
- [✓] Well-documented code and usage instructions
- [✓] Thorough testing of all components
- [ ] Bug fixes and simplifications applied

## Progress Tracker
- Version 1.7 (In Progress): Fixing image generation bug, simplifying transcription models, removing diarization
- Version 1.6: Added Rich Terminal UI and standalone image generation demo
- Version 1.5: Improved project structure, enhanced error handling, better logging
- Version 1.4: Added local Whisper support, fixed API issues, improved diarization
- Version 1.3: Fixed GPT-Image-1 API issues, improved speaker diarization

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix image generation functionality
- [ ] Simplify transcription to only use whisper-1 model
- [ ] Remove speaker diarization functionality
- [ ] Enhance test coverage
- [ ] Optimize performance for large audio files
