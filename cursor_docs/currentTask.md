## Context

The Whisper Transcription App is a command-line tool that allows users to transcribe audio from files or live recordings using OpenAI's Whisper API. Recent additions have enhanced the application with post-processing capabilities using GPT-4.1, allowing users to generate summaries and cleaner versions of their transcripts. The app now also features image generation using OpenAI's GPT-Image-1 model with configurable quality and style options.

The application is built in Python and uses several libraries for audio processing and API interaction. The current implementation features a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete documentation:
   - Create comprehensive codebase summary
   - Prepare README.md for GitHub
2. Refactor code:
   - Add type hints
   - Improve error handling
   - Create reusable components

### Future Development
1. Implement configuration system for API keys and preferences
2. Add logging system for better debugging
3. Develop progress tracking for longer transcriptions
4. Explore possibilities for a web interface

## Notes and Considerations

- The current implementation relies on the OpenAI API for both transcription and post-processing, which requires managing API costs.
- Error handling needs improvement, especially for API failures and file operations.
- The application would benefit from a configuration system to manage API keys and user preferences.
- The UI is currently command-line based, which limits accessibility for non-technical users.
- Post-processing options could be expanded to include more specialized transformations of the transcript content.
