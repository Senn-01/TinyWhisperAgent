## Context

The Whisper Transcription App is a command-line tool that allows users to transcribe audio from files or live recordings using OpenAI's Whisper API. Recent additions have enhanced the application with post-processing capabilities using GPT-4o, allowing users to generate summaries and cleaner versions of their transcripts.

The application is built in Python and uses several libraries for audio processing and API interaction. The current implementation features a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete documentation:
   - Create comprehensive codebase summary
   - Prepare README.md for GitHub
2. Refactor code:
   - Add type hints
   - Improve error handling
   - Create reusable components

### Future Development
1. Implement configuration system for API keys and preferences
2. Add logging system for better debugging
3. Develop progress tracking for longer transcriptions
4. Explore possibilities for a web interface

## Notes and Considerations

- The current implementation relies on the OpenAI API for both transcription and post-processing, which requires managing API costs.
- Error handling needs improvement, especially for API failures and file operations.
- The application would benefit from a configuration system to manage API keys and user preferences.
- The UI is currently command-line based, which limits accessibility for non-technical users.
- Post-processing options could be expanded to include more specialized transformations of the transcript content.
